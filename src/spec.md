# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a responsive, multi-section marketing homepage inspired by tokenspot.com’s layout/interaction patterns, using original English copy, a distinct non-blue/purple theme, and locally generated visual assets.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page homepage with: top navbar (anchor links), hero (headline/subheadline + primary CTA), features/benefits, how-it-works, roadmap/timeline, FAQ accordion, and footer with link groups.
- Implement a coherent design system (colors, typography, spacing, buttons, cards) using Tailwind with a non-blue/purple primary palette.
- Add and reference generated static images from `frontend/public/assets/generated` (logo, hero illustration, feature icons, background pattern).
- Ensure responsive behavior across common breakpoints and accessible keyboard interaction for the FAQ accordion.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a modern, crypto/product-style landing page, jump between sections via navigation on mobile/desktop, expand/collapse FAQs accessibly, and see original visuals that load locally (not from the reference site).
