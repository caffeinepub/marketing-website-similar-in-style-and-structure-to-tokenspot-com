  "summary": "Diff adds a React+TS+Tailwind single-page marketing layout with navbar, hero, features, how-it-works, roadmap, FAQ accordion, and footer, plus a warm amber/orange dark theme. However, the required generated image assets are not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and feature icons sprite usage is not evident. The diff also introduces Internet Identity/react-query/backend scaffolding and strongly trading-focused copy that was not requested and conflicts with stated non-goals.",

      "reason": "Components reference images under /assets/generated, but the diff does not show any files added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Also, the required feature-icons sprite is not shown being used; features appear to use lucide-react icons instead.",
